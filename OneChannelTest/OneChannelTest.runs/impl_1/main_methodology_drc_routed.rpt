TIMING-14#1 Critical Warning
LUT on the clock tree  
The LUT adjustable_clock/ODDR_DACData2[11]_i_1 has been found on the clock tree. Run opt_design to optimize the clock trees, then re-run report_methodology. If LUT(s) are still present in the clock trees, modify the RTL or the synthesis options accordingly to move the clock gating logic to dedicated clock enable resources. Keep in mind that post-opt_design database cannot be used for pin-planning tasks

There is a large setup violation of -33.452 ns between r_dacActiveCore_reg[3]/C (clocked by CLK_OUT1_system_clk_creator) and adjustable_clock/counter_reg[5]/R (clocked by CLK_OUT1_system_clk_creator). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#219 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -33.452 ns between r_dacActiveCore_reg[3]/C (clocked by CLK_OUT1_system_clk_creator) and adjustable_clock/counter_reg[6]/R (clocked by CLK_OUT1_system_clk_creator). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
