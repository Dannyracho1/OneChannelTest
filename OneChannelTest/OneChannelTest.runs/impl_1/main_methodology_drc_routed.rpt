TIMING-6#1 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks CLK_OUT1_system_clk_creator and SYSCLK_P are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks CLK_OUT1_system_clk_creator] -to [get_clocks SYSCLK_P]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-14#1 Critical Warning
LUT on the clock tree  
The LUT adjustable_clock/ODDR_DACData7[11]_i_1 has been found on the clock tree. Run opt_design to optimize the clock trees, then re-run report_methodology.
